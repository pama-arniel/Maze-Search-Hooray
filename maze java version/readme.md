How To Run:

The program works for both single and multiple goals

Change the value of the fileName (string) to the directory
of the desired file/maze to be solved, which is found in the main function in MazeSolver.java

Also to change the spacing of the maze when printing change the value of the space (int)
in the main function.

To change the heuristic function to be used when solving the maze, change the value of
heuristics (String),a for straight line and b for manhattan.

In solving a multiple goal maze, the program will look for the nearest goal from the starting square
using the value obtained from the heuristics. This algorithm is proved to be inefficient.
